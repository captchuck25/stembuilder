-- 0029: Tower Builder — student saved designs.
--
-- Design notes (conventions follow bridge_designs / 0026):
--  * user_id TEXT references profiles(id) (profiles.id is TEXT — never uuid).
--  * One row per (user, name); the app upserts on that key exactly like
--    bridge_designs, and assignment work is keyed by name 'asgn_<id>'.
--  * height_feet / footprint_feet / load_lb are the locked scenario; nodes +
--    members are the canvas geometry (jsonb), cost/passed the last known
--    result, thumbnail a small JPEG data URL for My Work cards.
--  * assignment_id is reserved for the tower assignment loop (phase 2) — no
--    FK yet because tower_assignments does not exist; nulled at purge time
--    once it does (same guard pattern purge uses for bridge_designs).
--  * Account-scoped personal data: soft-deleted via deleted_at and wired into
--    soft_delete_user / purge_soft_deleted below (bridge_designs policy).
--  * RLS enabled with no permissive policies (service-role only) + the
--    restrictive exclude_soft_deleted policy from 0005 §2.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor (project: stembuilder), after 0028 and
-- BEFORE deploying the tower app code (its API routes need this table).
